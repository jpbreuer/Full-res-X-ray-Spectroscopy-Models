# Full-res-X-ray-Spectroscopy-Models
A jupyter notebook to play with and explore X-ray spectral models without any given response (full resolution) using the models available from PyXspec.

Ipy widgets are used to see the direct effect of varying temperatures or neutral hydrogen column density or other parameters on the spectral model.

Future ideas:
- add data/response and compare with full-res model
- different model comparisions
